## Hi there 👋 I'm a recent graduate of triple ten

My name is Christian and I am a Business Analyst that recently graduated form triple ten where I worked on 6 projects that were modeled after real world assignments. I have experience in SQL, Tableau, Pivot Tables, Microsoft Power BI, data visualization and business analytics. My goal is to use my skills to best promote growth and understanding with data.

My experience is mostly in the customer service industry but I am excited and fully committed to this profession. The service industry is very challenging. It has made me a more efficient communicator, develped my stress level management when working under pressure, and it has tought me the value of teamwork. The curriculum at Triple Ten included data visualization, communication skills, SQL, PYTHON, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau and more.
