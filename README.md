## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a recent graduate of triple ten

My name is Christian and I am a Business Analyst that recently graduated form triple ten where I worked on 6 projects that were modeled after real world assignments. I have experience in SQL, Tableau, Pivot Tables, Microsoft Power BI, data visualization and business analytics. My goal is to use my skills to best promote growth and understanding with data.

My experience is mostly in the customer service industry but I am excited and fully committed to this profession. To the contrary of what people may belive the service industry is challenging and it also teaches you useful skills. It has made me a more efficient communicator, develped my stress level management when working under pressure, and it has tought me the value of teamwork. The reason for my carreer change is to challenge myself and to be a greater asset to my employer. Getting into Business Analytics has presented me the opportunity to offer more of my talents and use them to help a company reach their goals. The curriculum at Triple Ten included data visualization, communication skills, SQL, PYTHON, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau and more. 

Some facts about me:
- I love meeting new people and learning about their background.
- I am teaching myself tennis through online videos.
- Music is one of my biggest interests.
- My goal this year is to be more ambitious and land a job in analytics.
